# Library Inventory Manager

This is a simple Python-based Library Inventory Management System created using
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It uses a text file (`library.txt`) to
store book records and provides a menu-driven Command Line Interface (CLI).

This version is implemented in a **single Python file**:  
`book.py`

---

## Features

- Add Book
- Issue Book
- Return Book
- Search Book by Title
- Search Book by ISBN
- View All Books
- Stores data in a TXT file (`library.txt`)
- Clean and simple menu interface
- Fully OOP (Book + Inventory classes)

## Usage

To run the Library Inventory Manager, simply execute the main Python file:

A menu-driven interface will appear in the terminal, allowing you to:

All book data is automatically saved inside `library.txt`.
